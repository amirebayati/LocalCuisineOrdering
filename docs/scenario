Introduction: 
Luffy (LUFFY) is a system that connects local/home food producers with interested customers.

Goals:
Customer: Provide a high‑quality service for experiencing and discovering local dishes—diverse and little‑known—from all over the country, without spatial or temporal limitations; move beyond a purely traditional setting to experience local foods.
Producer: Create a safe and cost‑effective space to increase the income of home-based and local producers.

Description:
The user enters the food‑ordering website and, through the system’s user interface, gains access to chefs and their menus.
Using the system’s search and filter tools, the user looks for the desired dish, selects it, and is taken to the dish page.
On the dish page, the user enters order details such as quantity, dish specifics, delivery address, preferred delivery time, and any other requests.
The user then enters personal information to register and verify their identity.
The user reviews the order and, if needed, applies final changes.
The user chooses a payment method and, after payment is confirmed, finalizes the order.
The system sends the order information to the chef to prepare the food.
Based on the order details, the chef begins cooking.
Once ready, the food is packaged hygienically by the chef or the kitchen team.
During packaging, information about how the packaging is done and how food temperature will be maintained is recorded/communicated for delivery.
The system assigns a courier to collect and deliver the order.
The courier picks up the order from the chef/restaurant and heads to the specified delivery address.
