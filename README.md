# Local Cuisine Ordering — Analysis & Design Artifacts

LocalCuisineOrdering is a system concept that streamlines the ordering process for traditional/local cuisine, providing an intuitive interface for customers and efficient management tools for vendors. This repository contains the system’s analysis and design deliverables, including ER diagrams, data flow diagrams, flowcharts, Gantt and CPM schedules, and a clickable prototype preview.

## Overview
This repository documents the system analysis and design for a Local Cuisine Ordering platform. The artifacts can be used to:
- Communicate system scope and processes
- Align stakeholders on requirements and flows
- Serve as a blueprint for future implementation

## Goals
- Simplify discovery and ordering of local/traditional dishes
- Support vendors with menu, order, and inventory management
- Ensure a smooth ordering experience from browse to delivery/pickup
- Provide a scalable and maintainable architecture

## Stakeholders & Key Features
- Customers
  - Discover local dishes and vendors
  - Place and track orders
  - View order history
- Vendors
  - Manage menus, pricing, and availability
  - Receive and process orders
  - Track order statuses and inventory
- Administrators
  - Oversee vendor onboarding and quality
  - Monitor system health and compliance

## How to Use These Materials
- Start with the [Context Diagram](docs/diagram/analysis/3.CONTEXT%20DIAGRAM.pdf) to understand the system boundaries and external actors.
- Review high-level flows in [DFD Level 0](docs/diagram/analysis/4.DFD%20l0.pdf) and drill down into [DFD Level 1](docs/diagram/analysis/5.DFD%20l1.pdf) for details.
- Consult the [ER Diagram](docs/diagram/data-model/6.ERD.pdf) for the data model and relationships.
- Use the [Flowchart](docs/diagram/behavior/8.Flowchart.pdf) and [STD](docs/diagram/behavior/7.STD.pdf) to validate behavior across typical and edge-case scenarios.
- Explore the [Prototype (PDF)](docs/prototype/prototype.pdf) and watch the [Video Walkthrough](media/pt.mp4) to visualize user interactions.
- Reference the [Gantt](docs/diagram/planning/1.Gantt.pdf) and [CPM](docs/diagram/planning/2.CPM.pdf) files for project planning and critical path insights.
## Roadmap
Planned next steps for turning the design into a working product might include:
- Choosing an implementation stack (e.g., web/mobile frontend, backend API, database)
- Building core modules: authentication, vendor management, menu/catalog, cart/checkout, orders, notifications
- Integrations: payments, maps/delivery, analytics
- Testing and deployment pipeline

If you’re interested in helping define or execute the implementation, please open a discussion or issue.

## Contributing
Contributions to improve the design artifacts or begin implementation are welcome.
- Propose changes by opening an issue describing your suggestion
- If contributing designs, attach updated diagrams or link to design files
- Keep artifact naming consistent and place files at the repository root unless there’s an agreed structure
